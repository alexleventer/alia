(defn execute-chan-buffered
  "Allows to execute a query and have rows returned in a

  row. By default the query `:fetch-size` inherits from the cluster
  setting, unless you specify a different `:fetch-size` at query level
  and the channel is a regular `clojure.core.async/chan`, unless you
  pass your own `:channel` with its own sizing
  caracteristics. `:fetch-size` dicts the chunking of the rows
  returned, allowing to stream rows into the channel in a controlled
  manner.
  If you close the channel the streaming process ends.
